In Fall 2024 I had done several assignments covering different concepts from Computer Network. I worked with **Cisco Packet Tracer**. I had several projects:

During our assignments in Cisco Packet Tracer, I worked extensively with core networking devices such as end devices (PCs, laptops), routers, and switches. A significant part of the tasks involved configuring these devices manually to simulate real-world networking scenarios.

I designed subnetworks and assigned IP addresses based on calculated subnet masks. This included determining the number of required subnets and hosts, and then distributing addresses accordingly. I also manually configured default gateways for the end devices to ensure proper routing.

Connectivity testing was a frequent task—primarily using the **ping** command to check communication between devices within and across networks. I used **traceroute** to analyze the path taken by packets and measure the number of hops between devices, which helped in diagnosing connectivity or routing issues.

We often verified cabling and physical connections and ensured logical connections using proper port assignments and interface settings.

I also used **Wireshark** to monitor and analyze network traffic, gaining insight into protocols like ICMP, ARP, and TCP. This provided hands-on experience with packet-level communication and helped us understand how data travels through the network.

Working with the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** on routers and switches gave me experience with fundamental commands for interface configuration, routing protocol setup, and device diagnostics.

Additional tasks we explored in Packet Tracer at an easy to moderate level included:

•	Configuring **static and dynamic routing** (e.g., RIP)

•	Setting up **VLANs** for network segmentation

•	Using **DHCP** to assign IP addresses automatically

•	Implementing **basic security measures**, such as password protection on router access

•	Configuring **DNS** and **web servers** for simple service simulation

•	Testing network performance and troubleshooting various issues
